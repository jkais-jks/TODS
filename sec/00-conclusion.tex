\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose the \ours framework to select a good coreset over the incomplete data, which achieves data-effective and data-efficient ML. We formulate it as an expected optimal coreset selection problem, which is NP-hard. Then we propose a greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio. We also propose to involve imputation-in-the-loop strategies into \ours to  improve the efficiency. Furthermore, a group-based acceleration method is incorporated to further accelerate the coreset selection process. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of \ours and \texttt{GoodCore}$^+$.
